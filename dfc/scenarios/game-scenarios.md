## Take & Hold

Your forces advance, ready to take the fight to the enemy on the surface and in the space above. But they are just as determined to hold the key strategic areas on this war-torn planet. Take the important landing sites and destroy their ships before they do the same to you!

![Take & Hold map](/img/ui/400x400.svg "Take & Hold")

* 2 players.
* Fleet List: Standard.
* Suggested Approach: Column (opposing edges shown in blue).

## Erupting Battlefront

What seemed like a Recon skirmish was in reality the prelude to a fleet sized
engagement, with the foe making a play for key sectors on the surface. Capture and hold them quickly; your reinforcements are en-route, but so are the enemy's...

## Moonshot

Operations in strategically useful cities on the ground have be hampered by the presence of a large solid object in orbit, allowing light enemy fleets to engage in hit and run attacks and use piratical tactics. Such a physical impediment to orbital combat must not be used by the enemy to delay conquest of the surface.

Hold the space stations and ground support clusters close to it to deny the adversary this advantage.

* Players: 2 players.
* Fleet List: Standard.
* Suggested Approach: Battle Line (12" along opposing board corners shown in blue).

## Power Grab

This region's main weakness is intermittent and shifting power supply, often generated by unstable power sources. Holding these generators could deliver the whole region, but denying them to the opposing forces is the long term aim, one way or another.

![Power Grab map](/img/ui/400x400.svg "Power Grab")

* Players: 2 players.
* Fleet List: Standard.
* Suggested Approach: Column (12" along opposing board corners shown in blue).
* Duration: 6 turns.
* Orbital Debris: Debris Fields (2-8 Fine, 6-10 Dense).
* Victory Conditions: Clusters (Standard Scoring, Critical Locations). Clusters Containing Power Plants are worth double Victory Points but nothing if the Power Plants is destroyed.

::: tip Variant: "Bifuricate"
Remove the Debris Fields and place a Planetary Ring Vertically through the centre of the table.
