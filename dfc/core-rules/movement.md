# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

A group does not have to maintain a specific formation when it moves and each ship can move individually. For a move to be legal all of the Group’s ships must obey the coherency rules at the end of their movement.

## Moving between orbital layers

A ship may move voluntarily up or down one orbital layer (e.g. from High Orbit to Low Orbit, or Atmosphere to Low Orbit) as a part of its movement, once per turn. However, it must be able to turn to do so. This means that ships that have **Weapons Free, Active Scan** or **Silent Running** special orders on them or ships that cannot turn for any other reason may **not** change Orbital Layers.

Ships may go down an Orbital Layer at any point in their movement for no penalty to their movement (other than those associated with going into Atmosphere - see the Atmosphere section for details).

**A ship must expend 4  of its available Thrust to move up an Orbital Layer. A ship that does not have 4  of Thrust available may not move up a layer**.

## Ramming

With the vast speeds involved in space travel, when two objects collide it mostly results in both objects being obliterated. With this in mind, even the most insane or bloodthirsty captains will avoid ramming their ship into another for risk of both being consumed in the inevitable explosion. However, in certain circumstances, when there is nothing else to loose, incredibly desperate captains have been known to rush dangerously close towards the enemy in the hopes of taking them with them. In such circumstances it is often the close range exchanges of weapon systems or the critical overloading of the ships jump drives that do the most damage, on rare occasions though the doomed ship will manage to make contact with their target, frequently consuming both in the destructive energies unleashed.

Only large ships have the mass to survive the desperate defensive fire thrown up by the enemy ship and as such, **only ships of medium tonnage or larger my attempt this manoeuvre**. As a captain must be desperate to attempt such an action his ship must abide by the following criteria:

* The ship must have two or fewer Hull Points remaining.
* The ship must choose Standard Orders this turn and may not fire.
* If the ship ends its activation within 3 of an enemy ship it may attempt to ram them.

Roll a dice. On a 1-2 the attempt has failed and the enemy ship succeeds in destroying the Ramming ship; remove the ship from play and do not roll for Catastrophic Damage. On the roll of a 3+ the Ramming action is a success and they have successfully crashed into/detonated their jump drives/unleashed a devastating final volley. Remove the Ramming ship and do not roll on the Catastrophic Damage table. The target ship takes a number of Lock 3+ hits equal to the Ramming ship’s original Hull value.
