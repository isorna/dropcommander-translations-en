# Battlegroup Cards & the Strategy Deck

The order that ships activate in is dictated by the owning player’s strategy deck and this deck is made up of Battlegroup cards. A Battlegroup card might represent just a lone, powerful ship but more commonly it will comprise several Groups of ships.

At the start of each turn both players build their own strategy deck out of their force’s available Battlegroup cards, stacking them in the order they intend them to be activated in over the course of the coming turn.

A player’s number of available Battlegroup cards are determined when they pick their fleet (see Building Your Fleet for more details). It can potentially be varied by circumstances like scenarios requiring reserve Battlegroups to be held off-table or casualties wiping out whole Battlegroups.

## Strategy Rating

A Battlegroup card’s Strategy Rating is used to determine which player’s Battlegroup activates first. When the players reveal two opposing Battlegroup cards the Strategy Ratings on the cards are compared and the lower Strategy Rating can choose to activate before or after the Battlegroup with the higher Strategy Rating.

The Strategy Ratings for Battlegroup cards are determined by the Battlegroup’s type and size, reflecting the fact that a small scouting group will be able to react more quickly than an orbital bombardment group. For details on making up your own Battlegroups see Building Your Fleet.

## Equal Strategy Ratings

If two battlegroup cards are revealed which have the same Strategy Rating both players roll a D6 and add their Admiral Value (see Admirals for details), the player with the highest total chooses who goes first   If both players total is the same, roll again until one players total is higher.

## Losing Battlegroups

When all of the ships in a Battlegroup have been destroyed or are off the table for any reason the corresponding Battlegroup card is removed from the player’s strategy deck and put to one side. If you reveal a Battlegroup card that no longer has any ships remaining, remove it from your deck and reveal the next card.
