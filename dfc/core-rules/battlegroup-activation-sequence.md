# Battlegroup Activation Sequence

When a Battlegroup’s card is flipped all the groups in the Battlegroup proceed to activate one at a time in a sequence decided by the owning player. An active group takes orders and must complete all of that order’s moving, shooting and other actions before another group can activate.

It isn’t necessary for a player to nominate the sequence of group activation before starting. Players choose the first group to activate, complete all of its actions, and then chose the next, in any order they like (as which they choose may be determined by a previous Group’s successes or failures!). Once all of the groups in the Battlegroup have activated the Battlegroup’s actions are over for that turn.
