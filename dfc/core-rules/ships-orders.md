# Ship’s Orders

When activating any ships in a Battlegroup, the player may opt to use Standard Orders **or** one of many special orders. Generally a ship may turn, then move, then fire its weapons. A ship must do those in that order unless otherwise specified, although the amount of each depends on the order given.

Choose whether or not to have a ship on special orders before moving or shooting with it. Special orders are powerful abilities that allow greater tactical flexibility. Each comes with their own pros and cons, often trading usefulness for an increased visibility (see Spikes for more details).

**All the ships in a battlegroup have to work together so only one  special  order can be chosen each time the battlegroup activates**. The individual ships in each of the battlegroup’s groups can opt to use the battlegroup special order chosen for that turn or to use Standard Orders instead.

**Ships outside their group cohesion range (see above) can only use standard orders**.

## Standard orders

Remove a Minor Spike from the ship at the beginning of its activation.

The ship may turn by up to 45 degrees at the **beginning** of its activation, and then must move between half and full its Thrust value. It may then fire up to one weapon system.

## Special Orders

### Station Keeping

The ship may use from none to half of its Thrust value to move, turn by up to 45 degrees at the **beginning or end** of its movement and may then fire up to one weapon system. Add a Minor Spike to the ship at the end of its activation.

### Course Change

The ship must move between half and full its Thrust value, and may turn up to 45 degrees **twice** at any point in its movement. It may then fire up to one weapon system. Add a Minor Spike to the ship at the end of its activation.

### Max Thrust

The ship may turn up to 45 degrees at the beginning of its movement and then must move **between its full and double its Thrust value**. **It may not fire any weapon systems**. Add a Minor Spike to the ship at the end of its activation.

A ship on Max Thrust may not use launch assets.

### Silent Running

The ship may not turn, and must move between half and full its Thrust value.

It may not fire any weapons systems. Remove all energy spikes from the ship at the end of its activation. **The ship’s Signature is reduced to 0 until the start of its next activation**. Use the status wheel on the ship’s base to indicate that it is silent running.

A ship on Silent Running may not use launch assets.

### Weapons free

The ship may not turn, but must move between half and full its Thrust value. It may then fire any number of weapon systems. Add a Major Spike to the ship at the end of its activation.

### Active Scan

The ship may not turn, and must move between half and full its Thrust value. It may then fire up to one weapon system. Also place a Minor Spike on any one enemy ship on the tabletop. Add a Major Spike to the ship at the end of its activation.

**Ships in Atmosphere and/or with less than 4 hull points on their starting profile may not use this order**.

**Only one ship per Group may use this order**.

A ship using Active Scan can attempt to reveal a ship that is Silent Running, although success is by no means assured. When choosing a target ship to Active Scan, roll a die. On a 4+ the Silent Runner is spotted   reset the status wheel to show that its normal Signature applies. In this case no additional energy spike is added to the revealed ship although subsequent Active Scans or effects that add spikes will add the appropriate spike level.
