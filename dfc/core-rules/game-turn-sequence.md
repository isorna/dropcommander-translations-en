# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

A game of Dropfleet Commander is played out in a series of turns. The number of turns played will vary depending on the scenario being played but four to six turns for a game is typical. In each turn all of the ships on the tabletop will get a chance to move and shoot, known as Activating. The order that ships activate in is determined by their Strategy Rating.

A turn is divided up into 3 phases, with each phase being split up into segments. Some segments (like those in the [Activation Phase](#activation-phase)) may be repeated or have steps to follow within them.

Every ship in a player's fleet is fielded as part of a Group, which is a part of a larger formation called a Battlegroup. During the turn, Battlegroups on the tabletop activate one after another and the sub group of ships in them take their actions individually in an order of the controlling player's choosing.

Once all Battlegroups have been activated play moves to the Roundup Phase.

## Planning phase

1. **Pick Battlegroup Cards:** Each player picks up their Battlegroup cards and stack them face-down into Strategy Decks. When all players are ready the activation phase begins. Battlegroups that are unavailable to activate (usually for scenario reasons) may not be included in the strategy deck this turn
1. **Discard Cards:** Each player may now discard any unwanted Command Cards.
1. **Draw Cards:** Each player may now draw cards up to the Admiral Value (AV) of their most senior friendly Admiral on the table.
1. **Cleanup:** Any affects that result from special rules or Command Cards are addressed now.

## Activation Phase

1. Both players reveal the top card of their strategy decks.
1. Compare the Strategy Rating on the cards revealed. The player with the lower Strategy Rating chooses whether they will go first or second. In the event of a draw both players roll a D6 and the high roller chooses who goes first. If both players roll the same number, roll again until one player rolls higher.
1. The first player activates the Groups indicated on their Battlegroup card one-by-one in the order they choose and completes all of their actions.
1. The second player then activates the Groups indicated on their Battlegroup card one-by-one and completes all of their actions.
1. The Battlegroup cards are placed on the discard pile.
1. Return to 1. When both players have no Battlegroup cards left to reveal, play moves onto the Roundup Phase.

## Roundup phase

1. **Ground Combat:** Resolve any ground asset movement and combats.
1. **Launch Assets:** Resolve any launch assets.
1. **Damage Control:** Roll for damage control on ships suffering from ongoing crippling damage results.
1. **Orbital Decay:** Resolve any orbital decay.
1. **Collect Victory Points**: Indicated by the scenario being played.
1. **Remove any excess dice and tokens from the table**.
