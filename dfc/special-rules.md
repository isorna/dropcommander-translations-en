# Special rules

## Ship Special Rules

::: tip _While most eventualities and ship types are covered in the rules above, certain ships have abilities and attributes that are out of the ordinary and require special rules to address this_.
:::

### Ablative Armour

::: tip _Early human-built ships used large blocks and plates cast out of ceramic composites. These had excellent defensive qualities but were found to degrade rapidly in effectivess during heavy combat_.
:::

A ship with Ablative Armour increases its Armour by 2 points (e.g. 5+ Armour becomes 3+ Armour) until it is Crippled. At that point this bonus is lost for the rest of the game.

### Aegis (X)

::: tip _Aegis ships are typically equipped with sensors and weaponry that permit a blindingly fast response time against Strike Craft and munitions. They are normally deployed as scouts or to help protect other ships in battle_.
:::

Ships with the Aegis special rule add a bonus to the Point Defence value of any friendly ships within 4" of them equal to the number shown in brackets. In order to be affected, ships must be on the same Orbital Layer as the Aegis ship, additionally the bonus also applies to the Aegis ship itself.

::: info _For example: A ship with the Aegis (5) special rule is within 4" of a friendly ship with a PD characteristic of 4. As long as they remain within 4" the friendly ship counts as having a PD of 9_.
:::

### Atmospheric

Only ships with the Atmospheric special rule are capable of entering the Atmospheric layers during Orbital Combat.

### Beast

::: tip _Some technologies integrate their crews so closely with their ship control systems that the vessels behave more like living creatures than machines_.
:::

The Lock numbers of all of a Beast ship’s weapon systems are reduced by one when it suffers a Crippling Damage result. However, the strain of overload causes the beast ship to suffer another Crippling Damage result at the end of each activation.

### Detector

::: tip _Detector ships have extraordinarily acute sensors and high speed information dissemination systems that relay their scanning feeds to the rest of the fleet_.
:::

Detector ships may always use Active Scan special orders even if their battlegroup has chosen a different special order for the turn. Every Detector ship in a Group may Active Scan, not just one - choose all Detector ships you wish to Active Scan simultaneously.

### Dreadnought

A Battlegroup containing a Dreadnought may not contain any other ships. A Dreadnought has a tonnage of 30 (hench the S2 in the profile). A Battlegroup containing a Dreadnought may exceed the normally allowed 33% of your fleet’s points cost.

If taken, your Admiral **must** be mounted in a Dreadnought.

Dreadnoughts use special Crippling Damage and Catastrophic Damage tables, shown in the damage section. In addition, roll on the Crippling Damage table when the ship is reduced to 18 Hull or less and 10 Hull or less instead of the usual 50% of original hull.

### Full-Cloak

::: tip _A few rare ships are so efficient at covering their emissions that they are virtually ghosts_.
:::

A ship with the Full Cloak special rule can never receive an energy spike for any reason, until it is Crippled.

### Launch

Ships with the Launch special rule are capable of carrying and using Launch Assets. Launch capable ships will have their launch capacity noted in their descriptions along with the standard type load carried (i.e. Fighters, Bombers or Torpedoes as appropriate).

### Monitor

::: tip _These ships feature undersized and underpowered drives, but are configured specifically for the orbital defence role_.
:::

Monitors may not use Course Change or Max Thrust special orders. Weapons fired by Monitords suffer no Lock penalty for firing between Low and High Orbit.

### Open

::: tip _Some ships are designed to operate alone and away from other members of their Battlegroup_.
:::

Ships with the Open rule do not need to maintain coherency with other members of their Group or Battlegroup and the Battlegroup will suffer no negative modifiers to their strategy rating while ships with this rule are out of coherency.

### Outlier

Ships with this rule may ignore Battlegroup (but not Group) coherency rules, and the Battlegroup will suffer no negative modifiers to their Strategy Rating while ships with this rule are out of Battlegroup coherency.

### Partial Cloak

A ship with the Partial Cloak special rule can only ever receive a Minor Spike, it may never be increased to a Major Spike. If a rule or weapon would cause this ship to gain Major Spike, it instead gains a Minor Spike (or nothing at all if it already has a Minor Spike). This rule ceases to work when the ship is Crippled.

### Rare

::: tip _Rare ships are simply not available in large numbers due to their specialised nature or high demand_.
:::

You may only take a maximum of one of each Rare Group in a Skirmish sized game, two in a Clash and three in a Battle.

### Reinforced Armour

::: tip _Some ships have unbelievably dense armour sometimes mated with hull shapes perfectly designed to deflect attacks_.
:::

A ship with Reinforced-Armour only suffers Critical Hits from attack dice that score three more above their Lock number instead of two.

### Regenerate (X)

::: tip _Ships with the Regenerate characteristic have self-sealing hulls and rapid replication technology that allows them to quickly repair damage in combat_.
:::

A ship with Regenerate can make a number of damage control rolls equal to (x) in the Roundup phase of the turn to regain lost hull points.

::: info _For example, a ship with Regenerate (3) could roll up to three damage control dice to restore lost hull points during the Roundup phase of the turn_.
:::

Crippling Damage shuts down the ship’s ability to Regenerate lost hull points for the remainder of the game. The ship can still attempt to repair Crippling Damage results as usual, but the Regenerate ability cannot be repaired. Regenerate damage control rolls also may not be modified for any reason. Note that there is still a chance of the ship taking additional Hull damage if it rolls a 1 on a Regenerate damage control dice - things don’t always work right.

### Stealth

::: tip _Stealth ships are constructed with additional subsystems to disguise limited use of weapons and mask the presence of a firing ship_.
:::

A ship with the Stealth special rule may fire a single weapon system when using Silent Running special orders (note this also means it can use close action weapons when Silent Running).

The Stealth special rule only applies while the ship is still uncrippled, so once it loses 50%+ of its Hull the Stealth rule no longer applies.

### Vectored

::: tip _Some ships are incredibly agile, able to turn and change direction in the blink of an eye_.
:::

Ships with this rule are able to turn at any point in their movement, instead of when the order they have chosen states.

## Weapon System Special Rules

### Air-to-Air

::: tip _Weapons systems designed for use in space are less effective when trying to fire through a planet’s Atmosphere - projectiles burn up due to friction and energy weapons ionise uncontrollably. A few specialist ships, however, have weapon systems purpose-made for use in atmosphere_.
:::

While in atmosphere, weapons with this rule ignore the usual penalty to Lock Value and gain -1 to their Lock value when firing at ships in atmosphere. All other penalties still apply, including needing a 6+ to shoot at ground targets. Air to Air weapons gain no benefit from this rule when firing from outside atmosphere. Air to Air weapons that also have the Close Action rule may be fired at targets in atmosphere in addition to other Orbital Layers.

### Alternate fire weapons (Alt-X)

::: tip _Some weapon systems, most notably energy-based weaponry, can be fired with a variable focus or power output to generate significantly different effects_.
:::

A weapon system with Alternate fire modes will be represented by two or more lines on the weapon system characteristics with Alt followed by a number (e.g. Alt-1) in the special section. Only one weapon system with the same Alt number on the weapon characteristics may be fired by the same ship each turn.

### Bloom

::: tip _Some weapons give off an especially bright signature when fired_.
:::

Weapons with this special rule add a minor spike to the firing ship when this weapon is fired. This is in addition to any spikes gained from special orders or other sources.

### Bombardment

::: tip _Bombardment weapons are specialised systems designed to inflict maximum damage on surface-based targets_.
:::

Weapons with this special rule can only be used on ground sectors. In order to fire a bombardment weapon a ship must be in Low Orbit. A ship cannot use a Bombardment weapon while in Atmosphere, unless specifically stated.

Unlike other weapon systems bombardment weapons incur no penalties for firing through orbital layers or shooting through atmosphere - it’s what they’re made for.

### Burnthrough (X)

::: tip _Burnthrough weapon systems are typically lasers or particle lances which can melt straight through a ship if they are kept on target for long enough_.
:::

If an Attack dice for a Burnthrough weapon scores equal to or above its Lock number the Attack dice can be rolled again. If the second Lock roll is successful a third Lock roll can be made and so on until a Lock roll is failed. A Burnthrough weapon can score a maximum total of (X) total Hull damage points in one activation.

If a Critical Hit (i.e. rolling two or higher than the required lock number) is scored by a Burnthrough weapon, only that die will ignore the target’s Armour. Any subsequent hits rolled by this weapon against the same target during the same activation ignore the target’s armour too.

### Calibre (X)

::: tip _Certain weapon systems have been designed to be effective against ships of a specific size_.
:::

Weapons with the Calibre rule will be followed by either L, M, H, S which refers to the tonnage value they have been designed to target.

When these weapons are fired at targets with the same tonnage value as their weapon, reduce the lock value on their profile by 1. If the weapon has more than 1 tonnage value listed, then reduce the Lock when shooting at any of the listed tonnage values.

In addition, weapons with the Calibre H and/or S rule inflict Critical Hits on rolls exceeding their Lock value by ONE rather than the usual two (against targets of any Tonnage value).

::: info _For example; a weapon with a Lock of 5+ and the Calibre (L) rule is targeting a frigate. As frigates have a tonnage value of L (Light) you would reduce the Lock value of the weapon by 1 to 4+_.
:::

### Close Action

::: tip _Some of the most devastating weapon systems usable in space are only effective at relatively close range_.
:::

Close Action weapon systems may only be used against targets that are both within their fire arc and inside the firing ship’s Scan range. Close action weapons can be fired in addition to any other weapon systems permitted by a ship’s orders. A ship that is unable to use any of its weapon systems due to special orders may not use its close action weapons either.

Hits from Close Action weapons can be stopped by a target’s Point Defence. Resolve the effects of Point Defence before taking any Armour or Passive Countermeasures saving throws.

### Close Action (Swarmer)

::: tip _Swarmers are a sub-classification of close action weapons which use decoys, split projectiles and other countermeasures to make them more capable of overwhelming Point Defences_.
:::

It takes one Point Defence success more than normal to stop a point of Hull damage from a Swarmer weapon. This means that two successes are need to stop a normal hit from a swarmer, three successes for a critical.

### Close Action (Beam)

::: tip _Some close action weapon systems rely entirely on projected radiation of one form or another and so are entirely unaffected by Point Defences_.
:::

Close Action (Beam) weapon systems obey all the normal rules for close action weapon systems except one - Point Defences cannot be used against them at all!

### Corruptor

::: tip _Corruptor weapon systems cause ongoing damage to the target ship; Dangerous Malware, self-propagating corrosive materials, incendiaries or even biological organisms_.
:::

For every Critical hit scored by a Corruptor weapon, place 1 Corruptor token on the ship. At the beginning of each Damage Control phase, a ship with Corruptor tokens takes 1 Damage for each token, with no saves of any type allowed. A Corruptor token may be repaired just like a Crippling effect.

### Crippling

::: tip _Sitting at the very peak of military technology are weapons of such power that they can inflict Crippling Damage with a single hit_.
:::

Weapon systems with the Crippling characteristic inflict crippling damage when they score one or more critical hits in addition to any normal Hull Damage. Crippling damage is incurred regardless of the number of Hull points actually inflicted providing one or more Hull damage is suffered by the target. If a target ship is reduced to 50% hull or below by the attack it will need to make two Crippling Damage rolls and apply both of them.

If a weapon with the Crippling rule is affected by another rule which would make Critical Hits automatic (such as the Particle rule) then the roll you would have needed to achieve a Critical Hit is the roll required for the Crippling rule to take effect.

::: info _For example, a Lock 3+ weapon would need a 5 or 6 to make an additional roll on the Crippling table_.
:::

### Distortion

::: tip _Distortion weapon systems use the opening of short-lived space/time wormholes to tear targets apart so the more accurately the weapon hits the more damaging it becomes_.
:::

The damage value of a Distortion weapon system is equal to the number of hits the weapon system inflicts during the attack (before rolling any saving throws are rolled).

::: info _For example: A Distortion weapon with 4 Attack dice hits 3 times, this gives each hit a damage value of 3, so up to 9 Hull damage will be inflicted if all saves were failed! If the same weapon were to hit with all 4 attacks, it would inflict 16 Hull damage!_
:::

### Escape Velocity

::: tip _Escape Velocity weapon systems are specifically designed to target ships in higher orbital layers such as massive, ground based anti-ship weapons_.
:::

These weapons ignore the penalties for firing through different Orbital Layers (including Atmosphere) and may be fired from Atmosphere. However, they must always target an enemy in a higher Orbital Layer than themselves.

### Flash

::: tip _Weapon systems with the Flash characteristic produce a highly visible energy signature when they connect with a target, effectively ’lighting it up’ for everyone to see_.
:::

A ship that is hit by a Flash weapon system gains a Minor Spike in addition to any other damage effects. In addition, if the weapon system inflicts 3 or more damage from the attack, another Minor Spike is added to the target.

### Fusillade (X)

::: tip _Fusillade weapon systems feature enlarged capacitor banks or ammunition magazines so that they can really let loosed when the time is ripe_
:::

When a ship uses the Weapons Free order, Fusillade weapon systems add the X value to their Attack value to determine the number of shots the weapon system can make this turn.

### Impel (X)

::: tip _Impel weapons are unusual, esoteric weapons that impart a change in angular momentum to their target if they inflict enough damage_.
:::

If the firing player inflicts X damage (after saving throws have been taken) with a single weapon with the Impel (X) special rule, they may turn the target up to 45 degrees in either direction.

### Limited (X)

::: tip _Certain weapons are so large, require massive ammunition or overheat so quickly that it is only possible to fire them a limited number of times during an engagement_.
:::

Weapons with this rule will be expressed as L (X) in their special section. This weapon may only be fired X times in a game, so make your shots count! This can also apply to Launch Assets (typically to torpedoes), in which case the Asset may only be launched X times in a game.

### Link (X)

::: tip _Link weapon systems are configured in such a way that they can be fired simultaneously without impacting on a ship’s other functions_.
:::

A weapon with this rule will normally be paired with a second weapon with the same Link (X) value. In order for a ship to fire more than one weapon it is normally required to declare a Weapons Free special order. However, all weapon systems with the same Link (X) number count as a single weapon system for activation purposes, although they may be fired at different targets.

### Low Power

Up to 1 Low Power weapon (or multiple Low Power weapons with the Linked special rule) may be fired instead of Close Action weapons in addition to other weapons permitted by a ship’s orders.

A ship that is unable to use any of its weapon systems due to a special order (or Overcharging a weapon) may not u

### Mauler

::: tip _Maulers are a specialised kind of close action Burnthrough weapon that are particularly effective against thick armour as the pulses can be modulated to disrupt it at a molecular level_.
:::

Maulers work in the same way as Burnthrough weapons except that their Lock number is always equal to the Armour of the targeted ship (not Passive Countermeasures). Maulers are close action weapons so their damage can be mitigated by Point Defence (effectively it is disrupting the ionised trail).

::: tip _For example; A Mauler is being fired at a ship which has Armour 3+. The Lock number of the Mauler is therefore also 3+_.
:::

### Overcharge

A ship on the Weapons Free special order may choose to Overcharge this weapon (or group of Overcharge weapons with the Linked special rule).

Double the Damage value of these weapons.

If Overcharging, no other weapons (other than Close Action weapons) may be fired by the ship that turn. Launch Assets may still be deployed as normal.

### Particle

::: tip _Particle weapon systems are so devastating at the point of impact that physical armour and energy shields offer no defence against them_.
:::

Weapon systems with this rule always inflict Critical Hits if the Lock value of their attack is met and passive saves may not be taken against them.

### Re-Entry

Re-Entry weapons are capable of firing from Low Orbit into Atmosphere without any penalties to Lock for Atmosphere or crossing Orbital Layers.

Unless otherwise stated, Re-Entry weapons use Scan + Signature for their range.

Re-Entry weapons may not target Clusters or Sectors, although may shoot other targets outside of Atmosphere, following all the normal rules.

### Scald

::: tip _Scald weapon systems are ones that can pummel their targets whether with rapid fire bolts of superheated plasma or payloads of highly corrosive acid. They can literally melt their way through armour and internal components when fired at close range_.
:::

Armour against Hull damage from scald weapons suffers a +1 penalty when the firing ship is within Scan range of the target.

::: info _For example: A ship armed with Scald weapons hits a target that is within Scan range. The target’s Armour is usually 3+ so against this attack it becomes 4+ instead_.
:::

### Squadron-X

If a Group has assigned X or more weapons with Squadron to the same target, add a further D6 shots to the attack dice pool of those weapons. These shots are added to the attacks of one of the ships when rolling to hit (attacker’s choice), resolved with the same modifiers as that ship’s.

### Subsystem Network

Whenever a ship with this rule fires a weapon, it may also fire an additional weapon of the same type if it has one. That weapon still cannot fire twice during one turn (for example if it has the Linked special rule).

Weapons with Low Power and Subsystem Network may still use this rule even if firing on Low Power. Weapons that have been Overcharged cannot use Subsytem Network.

### Unstable

If any Unstable weapon with a random Attack value is fired on a Weapons Free order, the ship suggers 1 Hull Damage per maximum Attack value rolls.

If an Unstable weapon doesn’t have a random attack value, the ship suggers 1 Hull Damage for using this weapon on a Weapons Free order.

## Shaltari Special Rules

### Shaltari Shields

::: tip _All Shaltari combat vessels are equipped with highly advanced all-encompassing energy fields that can be raised in anticipation of enemy fire or lowered in favour of stealth_.
:::

At the start of any friendly Shaltari battlegroup’s activation, ships in that battlegroup can choose to raise their shields. Once raised, the shields must remain raised until the battlegroup next activates where the Shaltari player can choose to deactivate the shields (or keep them raised). When the shields are raised, the following rules take effect:

* The ship may use its Passive Countermeasures.
* The ship must now use the larger signature value in its profile
* The ship’s Point Defence is reduced to 0. Modifiers such as those made by escorting fighters still apply.
* The ship may not choose the Silent Running special order.

### Shield Booster

Once per turn, if a friendly ship within 4" and on the same Orbital Layer of a ship with this rule is targeted, the friendly ship may re-roll all failed Passive Countermeasures saves.

The ship with this rule can choose to target itself.

A ship with 13+ Hull Points requires 2 ships with Shield Booster in order to receive this bonus.

### Motherships & Gates

::: tip _The Shaltari deploy their ground forces in a very different way to other, less advanced races. Instead of risking their troops directly in a hazardous descent while physically present aboard dropships, they employ an interconnected web of teleport gates to transfer from a distant ship in orbit directly to the surface. That way, only the gate’s crew are at risk on approach rather than the whole payload of warriors. This fabulously advanced technology also brings with it the added benefit of being able to transfer forces on the ground between combat zones in the blink of an eye_.

_Motherships (which physically house the troops) provide the fulcrum of this technology while smaller Voidgates (the equivalent of Strike Carriers) and Gates (the equivalent of dropships) provide the point of entry to the battlefield. The latter is required as this technology requires a Gate to be physically present very near to the point of materialisation_.
:::

Motherships are the origin point for ground troops and these are physically carried aboard them. As such, they have a Launch capacity in same way as the troopships of other races and they use the same rules for when they may Launch. Motherships are identified as ships that have the option to launch Gates. Gates are a special type of Strike Craft unique
to the Shaltari and use the same rules as Dropships.

### Voidgate-X

::: tip _Voidgates are a stepping stone between the Mothership in orbit and the small, dropship- like Gates. Since Gates cannot deploy directly from space, a Voidgate is needed to enter the atmosphere and provide a point of entry for them_.
:::

When a Mothership is launching Gates, they are **not** deployed from the Mothership itself. Instead, they are deployed from Voidgates.

A Voidgate will have a Voidgate Capacity (Voidgate-X) in its special rules, which represents how many Gate tokens may be deployed through it each turn (note that this is frequently lower than the launch value of Motherships, meaning that you generally need multiple Voidgates to make full use of a Mothership’s potential Launch capacity).

In order to do this, the Voidgate must be within 18" of the Mothership OR within 18" of another Voidgate that is in turn within 18" of the Mothership. You may have more than 2 Voidgates in this chain as long as it is unbroken. Only the Capacity of the Voidgate deploying the Gates is used if multiple Voidgates are chained in this way.

The eldritch technologies and incredible energies involved in this process also have an offensive side effect - the air surrounding such constructs is loaded with energetic potential, ready to annihilate smaller enemy craft that get too close. If a Voidgate is within 6" of a Cluster then that Cluster counts as having a Defence Battery deployed in it when enemy Dropships or Bulklanders are deploying ground assets. However, Bulk Landers are destroyed on a 4+ rather than the usual 3+.

Voidgates can also be used to relocate Ground Assets once deployed. During the Ground Combat step of the Roundup Phase you may use nearby Voidgates to enhance the movement abilities of you existing ground forces.

Ground Asset tokens in Sectors within 3" of a Voidgate in Atmosphere or Space Stations in Low Orbit may be moved to another Sector within 3" of another Voidgate in Atmosphere or another Space Station within 3" of another Voidgate in Low Orbit anywhere else on the table.

If the token is being moved to a Sector within a Cluster containing an enemy Defence Battery, that token is destroyed on a roll of 6+.

Ground Assets may not be deployed through any Voidgate which has used the Max Thrust Special Order that turn although that Voidgate may still be part of a chain.

Any number of Ground Asset tokens may be picked up by a single Voidgate, but only one may be dropped per Voidgate per turn using this rule. Tokens picked up but not dropped in this manner are automatically destroyed.

Tokens moved in this manner count as **not** being present in their new Sector for the remainder of the turn (and therefore may not contribute to scoring that turn).

## Resistance Special Rules

### Elite Bridge Crew

A Resistance Fleet ship may remove a Major Spike when on Standard Orders.

In addition, when drawing Command Cards, Resistance players always draw 1 additional card, and then discard 1 card of their choice from their hand.
