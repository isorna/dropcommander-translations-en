## The Basics

### Is there a consistent hierarchy of rules?

We try to make the rules work together,
no matter their source, but in such a large
wargame, we don't always manage it! In
these fringe situations, it's best to confer
with your opponent to decide what makes
most thematic sense. And remember the
Golden Rule!

### This unit is different on the cards than the web builder, which one do I use?

Unit Cards. Though if you notice any
discrepancies from the cards to the web
builder let us know at [info@ttcombat.com](mailto:info@ttcombat.com).
As long as both you and your opponent
agree on which version to use, use that. If
not, use the cards.

### What happened to all the units, half my army has disappeared?

During the 2.2.0 balance pass, we changed
a lot about army composition, unit roles,
and unit stats. Some units got redeployed
into another role (like UCM praetorians
becoming troops) or merged into a single
unit profile with a choice of weapons
(like the PHR Thor being merged into the
Taranis). A couple of units are still missing
and are just waiting for parts to come off of
the assembly line. Don't worry, we haven't
forgotten about them!

### Where can I find the stats for Titania, Kalium, Aaru patterns of units?

There are several types of alternate sculpts
of their respective units, but they share
rules with the standard versions. The only
difference in game is how they look!

## Command

### Do Scouts and/or Commanders generate Influence when embarked in a Transport?

Yes. Measure from their Transport as if
measuring from the unit itself. Note that
this only affects Command Radius, not other
special rules.

### When a Scout or Commander is in a Garrison, should its Influence be measured from the centre of the building, or from the edges of the building?

From the edges of the Garrison.

## Shooting

### Can a Unit with a weapon with M&F 0" shoot if it disembarks from a Transport? Can it shoot if the Unit moved to a different edge in a Garrison? Can the Unit shoot the weapon if an Aerial Transport has them free disembark?

No. The Disembarking action applies all
penalties to shooting for the units activation,
this means the unit has moved for the
purposes of M&F 0" weapons.

### Can the Units at each end of two opposing squads organized in a perfect column target each other without modifiers, such as Hull Down?

Yes.

### Can Aircraft gain Hull Down when in the air or having landed, when less than 50% of them is visible?

Yes

### Can Infantry count as Hull Down if less than half are visible?

Yes. Remember that when shooting at Infantry
in a Garrison, you measure line of sight to the
edge of that Garrison, so you'd be judging Hull
Down based on how much of the Garrison you
can see, not the Infantry inside.

### Can friendly Units be targeted by a Shooting action?

No.
If for example a Unit of UCM Legionnaires has
1DP remaining, is the Unit forced to fire the
Missile Launcher or can it choose the Assault
Rifle or does it have a choice of either?
In this instance, all of the UCM Legionnaires
armed with Assault Rifles have been killed!
All that's left is the Missile Launcher (which is a
lot more valuable - you try explaining to the CO
why you left it behind).

### Can Accuracy be modified above a 6 or below a 0?

Yes. Accuracy can be modified to any number!
Simply add or minus all of the modifiers; that is
the result needed to hit.
Remember, a 1 always misses and a 6 always
hits.

### When a Squad that has a Unit out of coherency performs a Shooting action, does the whole Squad suffer the +1 Accuracy penalty, or just the individual Unit that is out of coherency?

The entire squad suffers a penalty for being out
of coherency.

### At what point in the Shooting action sequence is damage considered successful? Before or after Passive saves?

After Passive saves.

## Transports

### Is it possible for a Unit to be split across multiple transports? (e.g. could 3 base sof razor worms fit in 2 invaders) Does this also apply to units with the access rule? (e.g. could a leopard disembark from 2 Tegus)

A single unit must be able to fit inside a
single transport - matching their Capacity
and Requirement numbers. A squad however
can be split between multiple transports -
see "Embarking & Disembarking" for more
information.

### Do Units that have two transport Requirements listed count as one or both?

Either. Equally, a Transport with multiple
Capacity can count as either.
For example a Gun Technical counts as 1
Requirement in either "wheels" or "drills".
And a Kraken can transport up to 6 Capacity of
either "wheels" or "buses" or a mixture of both!

### Can non-Auxiliary Transports like the Njord,Thunderstorm or Firedrake embark units from another Battlegroup?

No.

## Aircraft

### When an Aircraft lands it is treated as a Vehicle, what specific bonuses are lost?

No bonuses in the core rules - this is simply for
a specific Aircraft that have bonuses.

### If an Aerial transport is destroyed and it has an embarked Transport which is also destroyed what then happens to the Infantry embarked in the Transport?

The Infantry test for their transport being
destroyed as per the normal rules, in a cascade
effect.

## Scenery

### Can Units operate and disembark on top of a Garrison? If yes, then is there a limit to their size? What happens to these units when the Garrison is destroyed?

Technically yes they can. However, they
would be bound by the standard placement
rules (just like on the rest of the board). In
practice we would advise against doing this
too often, as it can quickly get confusing
between units on top of a Garrison and units
inside a Garrison.
If a unit is on top of a scenery piece when it
is destroyed, that unit takes damage in the
same way as any other unit within 3" of the
scenery piece.

### If a Unit is on the roof of a Garrison, how would a unit in that Garrison target it? Is the top face of the Garrison considered an edge? Can a Unit exit onto the top of the building?

This is up to players to decide when
agreeing on scenery at the start of the game.
Personally, we wouldn't let units sit on top
of a Garrison in any place that a unit inside
could shoot up (they'd likely fall straight
through the gap).

### Can Passable scenery be targeted for a Shooting action?

Only scenery with the Destructible rule may
be targeted for a Shooting action. You can
make all scenery Destructible if you like,
but we'd highly advise against it for ease of
gameplay and for the sake of finishing your
game.

### If a weapon with Flame targets a Unit inside a Garrison that is not Destructible, how does the Collateral Damage token resolve?

No Collateral Damage tokens are placed if
the Garrison is not Destructible.

### Does Collateral Damage resolve when a Shooting action ends that targeted an occupied Garrison and no damage was applied?

No.

### Does Collateral Damage resolve at the end of an action that adds Collateral Damage tokens to an occupied Garrison?

Only a Shooting action.

### Is it correct that when a wheat field is destroyed that a 1D3 is rolled to determine the hits and range at Energy 5?

Yes. That fire spreads!

### How many infantry bases can fit at a wall?

You can have as many friendly infantry units
at a single wall as the garrison has space
for. While you still need to indicate their
presence inside in some way, you could use a
dice or a token instead of the entire squad of
infantry bases.

### Why can my large, monstrous infantry only enter via doors, do they need to ring a buzzer to get in?

Infantry don't have to enter via only a door,
whether they're PHR Immortals or Scourge
Screamers! They can also enter via a window
(which are present on the ground floor on
a number of the city/ruinscape buildings
as well as our Sci-Fi X range) or other areas
where the unit could feasibly enter.

## Scenarios

### During deployment can a player eassign Auxiliary Units and Initial Auxiliary transports to different Battlegroups or Squads?

During deployment, you choose to deploy
squads within Auxiliary Transports. It's
usually handy to do this before the game
during army creation to save time! Once
all Battlegroups are decided, deploy them
as normal. Any Auxiliary Transports
must be deployed as part of their cargo's
Battlegroup. You may also deploy additional
Auxiliary units (like an Archangel squad
for example) with a particular Battlegroup,
or on their own at the end. Then when the
game starts, the Battlegroups activate like
normal - assigning Auxiliary units to each
Battlegroup (or having them automatically
assigned if they have cargo inside).

### If there are Garrisons in your deployment zone and the Scenario specifies Directly Deployed, can Infantry start the game into them? If so then what happens to the transports that were originally assigned to these Infantry?

No, Infantry cannot be deployed directly into
a Garrison.

### Do Scan Tokens stack? Can a Unit use more than one Scan Token to modify a search roll?

Yes, a unit can use more than one Scan
Token.

### Is claiming a non-Mobile Open Objective equivalent to carrying the Objective?

No.

### Can an Infantry Unit pass a carried objective during its activation if it fails a fortitude test?

If an Infantry squad fails its Fortitude test,
it will immediately drop any Objectives it is
carrying. Those Objectives can be claimed
by enemy squads within 1", but not friendly
squads.

### Bunker Assault - if a player claims an Open Objective in the Garrison and their opponent has more points within 6", how are Victory Points awarded?

There are 2 ways of gaining Victory Points in
Bunker Assault. The Open Objectives can be
claimed by units inside following the normal
rules. In addition, the player with the highest
number of points of units within 6" of each
Garrison scores 2 Victory Points. So in the
above example, player A claims the Open
Objective and scores 1 Victory Point, but Player
B has more points within 6" and scores 2
Victory Points.

## Behemoths

### When do you measure from the spread of a Behemoth? Is it when shooting, moving, getting shot at?

Behemoth's use their Spread when they enter
play via Drop Harness, when moving, when
getting shot at, and when exploding.
Behemoth's shoot like normal units and use
their centre of mass as the origin point for
shooting.

### How does an Area weapon interact with Behemoth's, can I place the template anywhere in their spread, or is it placed directly on top?

Neither. The shot loses the Area rule for that
attack, so no template is placed and no other
units are damaged. The weapon otherwise acts
normally following the rules for shooting. Area
weapons that target other units or buildings
have no effect on Behemoths.

## Special Rules

### Do Units with Fast have to enter from their deployment zone edge?

Yes.

### Can a Unit with Fast come on a table edge without moving its minimum distance on the first turn it's on the board, or do you have to place it on the table edge and then move the minimum?

Fast units deploy on subsequent rounds in
exactly the same way as normal units, "make a
Moving action measured from any board edge
inside their deployment zone", so they would
be required to make their minimum move.

### Do the benefits of Rapid Insertion apply if the unit disembarks normally?

No. A unit must disembark from an Aerial
Transport that hasn't landed to gain any of the
benefits of entering straight into a Garrison
from any direction and not having to re-roll
successful damage rolls.

### Can a unit with 2 AA weapons fire one in reaction fire and another during its activation?

Yes, a unit can fire one or more of its AA
weapons in reaction fire and then fire any
weapons (including AA weapons) it hasn't fired
during it's activation as normal. Only the AA
weapons used in reaction fire cannot be used
during the units activation.

### What happens when I shoot at a building with an Indirect Area Weapon?

No blast template is placed, the shot loses the
area rule (and thus does not use a template),
but the weapon itself is still an area weapon and
deals D3 hits to a destructible scenery piece.

### Can a weapon with the focus rule combine successful hits to ignore passive countermeasures with an E13 shot?

No, Focus affects the energy of the shots, not
the weapon. An E5 weapon with focus is always
an E5 weapon, regardless of how much energy
the shot itself has.

### How do Limited-X weapons with Alternate Fire function?

Each Limited weapon may be used X number
of times, but only one ALT weapon can be used
each round.

### Can a Unit with a weapon that has Reduced X, reaction fire at Aircraft?

No. The Reduced special rule only gives the
weapon AA for that Shooting action, meaning
Reaction Fire is impossible.

### How does Strafe and Focus work together? If you use Strafe against the same target do we pool all shots together then apply the Focus rule or resolve each Strafe attack separately?

Strafe essentially means you fire the weapon
profile multiple times. Treat each as a different
weapon, resolving each one at a time.
For example if a weapon was Strafe-2 with
Focus (1) and 5 Shots at Energy 6, each of the 2
times you shoot you would be able to Focus up
to Energy 11.

### Can a weapon with Strafe target Destructible Scenery?

Yes.

### Does a weapon with Strafe-X and Flame that targets the same Garrison with all Strafe attacks generate one Collateral Damage token, or X number of tokens?

It generates 1 additional Collateral Damage
token per use, so a weapon with Strafe (4)
would generate 4 additional Collateral Damage
tokens if all of the uses are on a Garrison.

## Command Cards

### What command cards do I use, which are the current ones?

The current version of the command cards are
the TTCombat branded ones available on the
webstore. They contain 30 unique command
cards and 3 quick reference cards (and are
62mm x 100mm for those looking for sleeves).
The old 52 card packs are no longer used.
Remember that you can only have 1 of any
named card in your deck and your deck must
contain exactly 30 command cards. A single
pack (generic or otherwise) is the right amount
to play with. Once faction specific card packs
are released you can build your deck of 30 cards
from any available to your faction, but still
cannot have duplicate cards.

### Does the Marksmanship command card ignore Evasion countermeasures? Or just effects that explicitly reference Accuracy?

Marksmanship ignores all modifiers to
Accuracy, even Evasion Countermeasures.

### Does the Reinforced Steel command card re-roll dice against the scenery, the units,or the scenery and units? If it includes the units, are passive saves rolled before or after the re-roll?

It forces re-rolls on all successful Damage, from
both the Garrison and the Infantry inside. This
is done before Passive saves.

### If my opponent plays the Deploy Flares command card, what happens if I choose to use the Incendiary Rounds Command Card?

You can only ever re roll a dice once. For
example:
Player A: Roll to hit.
Player B: Plays Deploy Flares.
Player A: Rolls to damage.
Player A: Re-rolls only successful damage dice
due to Deploy Flares and does not re-roll any
dice that missed.
Player A: Plays Incendiary Rounds.
Player A: Re-rolls all failed damage dice from
the original roll, no other failed damage dice
are rerolled as they have already been re-rolled
once due to Deploy Flares.
Player A: Allocates damage as normal.

## UCM

### What happens to the Starsprite Drones of a Ferrum Drone Base when it embarks into a transport?

Nothing! They continue to operate as normal.

### Can I mount a commander in a Starsprite Drone?

No. Starsprite Drones are launched (not
disembarked) via a Ferrum Drone Base during
its activation. They are not embarked or
present before, or during deployment (they
simply don't exist at the point you assign
commanders).

### When a Phoenix becomes untargetable, can it be hit or damaged by weapons that do not require a target, such as being under an Area Template or being attacked by a weapon with Ion?

When it's untargetable it has 0 Damage Points
left, so damaging it wouldn't do much!

## Scourge

### Does the Annihilator land when it completes a Moving action?

Yes.

### How should the range of the Despot's Micro Subjugation Field be measured when it affects Infantry in a Garrison? As an example if a Despot is placed in base contact of a short edge of a rectangular Garrison with dimensions 3" by 6" are Infantry Units at the opposite edge affected? Are Infantry Units not at an edge affected?

Measure to the closest edge of a Garrison.
Any enemy units in that Garrison are affected,
regardless of which edge they are on.

### What amount of points do Razorworms from heavy tanks or the Corruptor count as for Victory Point and Kill Point conditions?

They count as their regular points value.

### Can an Emeritus Incendiary Drone use Self Destruct while airborne? If yes, can the weapon resolve damage against other Aircraft?

Yes it may Self Destruct while airborne, but the
weapon does not have the AA special rule, so
cannot target Aircraft, just anything under the
template as normal.

### Can the Screamer use Huge Claws to target a unit outside the Garrison?

Yes.

## PHR

### What happened to squads containing Type-1 Walkers and Type-2 Walkers? Is it a force builder limitation, or a rules change?

You can no longer take mixed squads

### Is it intentional that Valkyries are immune to Reaction Fire while using their Jump-Jet Packs when the Hera/Apollo can be targeted by Reaction Fire upon when using their Thrusters?

Yes. They're too small for accurate targeting!

## Shaltari

### Can a weapon with Focus combine hits to increase their Energy to negate the Active Countermeasures on a Unit that has a Warsuit/Heavy Warsuit??

No, since Focus is applied after rolling to hit.

### Can two units embark into the same gate, and each disembark from a different Haven or Tegu gate in a single activation?

Yes, they can disembark from different
transports, following the normal rules for
disembarking from multiple transports (make
sure they're in coherency etc).

### If in the same battlegroup a Tegu disembarks from an Eden, then a Haven disembarks from the Tegu, then a Yari disembarks from the Haven. Can the Yari then use its Light Ion Cannon?

Yes! The Yari disembarked from a Transport that
disembarked from a Transport which is not
an Aerial Transport (even if that did in turn
disembark from an Aerial Transport!). If you
pull this off, well done you - that's serious
dedication to Shaltnanigans.

## Resistance

### The Hydra's Scanner Array says "At any point during this unit's activation, pick an enemy unit within line of sight". Does that imply it can interrupt its move to pick an enemy unit in which it may not have had line of sight to at the beginning or end of the Moving action??

Yes.

### Can the Hydra pick Destructible Scenery with the Scanner Array?

No.

### Because the Rigged Explosives targets the Bomb bus itself and has Area, is it correct that this weapon cannot damage Infantry on edges and Destructible Scenery?

Correct, they cannot damage infantry on edges
or destructible scenery.
