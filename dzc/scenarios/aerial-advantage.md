Aircraft are able to react to dropzones much quicker than conventional ground-based war machines, and commanders are often the first to battle to oversee their forces.

Any Battlegroup that is **not** an HQ Battlegroup or a Battlegroup deployed entirely in Aircraft (including Auxiliary Transports) always starts the game In Reserve, regardless of the scenario rules.
